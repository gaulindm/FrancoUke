[C] Oh my [Am] love my [F] darling    
I've [G] hungered for your [C] touch    
A [Am] long lonely [G] time    
And [C] time goes [Am] by so [F] slowly    
And [G] time can do so [C] much    
Are [Am] you still [G] mine    
[C] I need your [G] love    
[Am] I need your [Em] love    
God [F] speed your love [G] to [C] me [C7]    
{c: } 
[F] Lonely rivers [G] flow to the [F] sea to the [Eb] sea    
[F] To the open [G] arms of the [C] sea    
[F] Lonely rivers [G] sigh wait for [F] me wait for [Eb] me    
[F] I'll be coming [G] home wait for [C] me
