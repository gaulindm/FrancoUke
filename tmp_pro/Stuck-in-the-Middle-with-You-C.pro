[C] Well I don't know why I came here tonight   
I got the feeling that something ain't right   
I'm so [F7] scared in case I fall off my chair   
And [C] I'm wondering how I'll get down the stairs   
[G] Clowns to the left of me [Bb] jokers to the [F] right   
Here I [C] am stuck in the middle with you   
{c: } 
[C] Yes I'm stuck in the middle with you   
And I'm wondering what it is I should do   
It's so [F7] hard to keep this smile from my face   
Losing con-[C]trol yeah I'm all over the place   
[G] Clowns to the left of me [Bb] jokers to the [F] right   
Here I [C] am stuck in the middle with you   
{c: } 
Well you [F] started out with nothin   
And you're proud that you're a self made [C] man   
And your [F] friends they all come crawlin   
Slap you on the back and say [C] please .[Gm7] please ..[C] [C]   
{c: } 
[C] Trying to make some sense of it all   
But I can see that it makes no sense at all   
Is it [F7] cool to go to sleep on the floor   
'Cause I [C] don't think that I can take any more   
[G] Clowns to the left of me [Bb] jokers to the [F] right   
Here I [C] am stuck in the middle with you   
{c: } 
Well you [F] started out with nothin   
And you're proud that you're a self made [C]  man  
And your [F] friends they all come crawlin   
Slap you on the back and say [C] please .[Gm7]  please ..[C] [C]
