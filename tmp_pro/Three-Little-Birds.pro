{c: } 
Don't [C] worry  about a thing,    
'Cause [F] every little thing  gonna be all [C] right    
Singin' don't worry  about a thing,    
'Cause [F] every little thing  gonna be all [C] right    
{c: } 
Rise up this mornin', smiled with the [G] risin' sun,    
Three little [C] birds pitch by my [F] doorstep    
Singin' [C] sweet songs of melodies [G] pure and true,    
Sayin', [F] this is my message to [C] you-ou-ou    
{c: }
