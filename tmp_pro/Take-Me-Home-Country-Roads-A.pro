{c: } 
[A] Almost heaven… [F#m] West Virginia   
[E] Blue ridge mountains [D] Shenandoah [A] river   
[A] Life is old there [F#m] older than the trees   
[E] Younger than the moun-tains… [D] blowing like a [A] breeze    
{c: } 
Country [A] roads… take me [E7] home   
To the [F#m] place… I be-[D]long   
West Vir-[A]ginia… mountain [E] mama   
Take me [D] home… country [A] roads   
{c: } 
[A] All my memories… [F#m] gathered round her   
[E] Miner’s lady… [D] stranger to blue [A] water   
[A] Dark and dusty… [F#m] painted on the sky   
[E] Misty taste of moonshine [D] teardrops in my [A] eye   
{c: } 
Country [A] roads… take me [E7] home   
To the [F#m] place… I be-[D]long   
West Vir-[A]ginia… mountain [E] mama   
Take me [D] home… country [A] roads   
{c: } 
[F#m]  I hear her [E7] voice in the [A] mornin’ hour she calls me   
The [D] radio re-[A]minds me of my [E] home far away   
And [F#m] drivin’ down the [G] road I get a feel-[D]in’ that I   
[A] should have been home [E] yesterday… yester-[E7]day   
{c: } 
Country [A] roads… take me [E7] home   
To the [F#m] place… I be-[D] long   
West Vir[A]ginia… mountain [E] mama   
Take me [D] home… country [A] roads   
Take me [E7] home… down country [A] roads   
Take me [E7] home… down country [A] roads [A] (single strum)
