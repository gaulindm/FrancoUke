{t: Spoof - Little Red Uke - Beach Boys sorta }  
{key: C}  
[C] [Am/C] [C] [Am/C] [C] [Am/C] [C] [Am/C]  
[C] Little red uke you don't know what I got   .   
[C] Little red uke you don't know what I got   .  
{c: } 
[C] Well I've got a uke babe so don't put me down   
She's the neatest little uke in [C7] all of the town   
When a [F] song comes along to me I don't have to try   
Cause I can [C] play three chords so I can get by 
{c: } 
    
She's my [G] little red [Dm] uke [G]    
You don't [Dm] know what I [C] got - (Little red uke you don't know what I got) 
{c: } 
[C] Just a little red uke with nylon strings   
When I pluck her or I strum her she [C7] really swings   
She [F] cost twenty bucks but I've got no regrets   
I've [C] lowered the saddle and filed all the frets 
{c: } 
She's my [G] little red [Dm] uke [G]    
You don't [Dm] know what I [C] got - (Little red uke you don't know what I got) 
{c: } 
She's got a [F] great little sound if the strings stay in tune   
When I [C] play by the light of the [C7] silvery moon   
And [F] if that ain't enough to make you flip your lid   
Sheâ€™ll [D7] sound even better when I [G7] fit the Aquilas 
{c: } 
So [C] why not grab a uke babe and join in the fun   
You can even join a club for uke a[C7]ppre-ci-a-tion   
You can [F] pick up ukuleles in various hues   
Of [C] yellow and pink and all sorts of blues 
{c: } 
Or get a [G] little red [Dm] uke [G]   
Now you [Dm] know what I [C] got - (Little red uke you don't know what I got)   
My [G] little red [Dm] uke [G]   
Now you [Dm] know what I [C] got - (Little red uke you don't know what I got)  
{c: } 
[C] Little red uke now you know what I got   .   
[C] Little red uke now you know what I got   .   
[C] Little red uke now you know what I got   
{c: }
