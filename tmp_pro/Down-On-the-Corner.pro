[C] Early in the evenin'   
[G] just about supper [C] time   
Over by the courthouse,   
they're [G] startin' to un-[C]wind.   
[F] Poor kids on the corner [C] tryinâ€™ to bring you up.   
Willy picks a tune out and he [G] blows it on the [C] harp. 
{c: } 
[F] Down on the [C] corner, [G] out in the [C] street,   
Willy and the [F] Poorboys are [C] playin';   
Bring a [G] nickel. Tap your [C] feet.   
[C] Rooster hits the washboard,   
[G] People just gotta [C] smile.   
[C] Blinkey thumbs a gut-bass [G] and solos for a-[C]while.   
[F] Poorboy twangs the rhythym out [C] on his kalamazoo   
And Willy goes into a dance and [G] doubles on ka-[C]zoo.
