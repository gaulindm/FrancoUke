{c: } 
[G] Daniel is travelling tonight on a [Am] plane   
[D] I can see the red tail lights [B7] heading for Spa[Em]in   
Oh and [C] I can see [D] Daniel waving good[Em]bye   
God it [C] looks like Daniel   
[D] Must be the [C] clouds in my [G] eyes [D7]   
{c: } 
[G] They say Spain is pretty though I've never [Am] been   
[D] Well Daniel says it's the best place   
[B7] That he's ever [Em] seen   
Oh and [C] he should [D] know he's been there en[Em]ough   
Lord [C] I miss Daniel [D] oh I [C] miss him so [G] much   
{c: } 
Oh oh oh [C] Daniel my brother you are [G] older than me   
Do you still [C] feel the pain of the [G] scars that won't heal   
Your eyes have [Em] died but you see more than [C] I   
[Cm] Daniel you're a [G] star [E7] in the face of the [Am] sky [D]
